# Sticky-Notes-Grid

Sticky Notes Grid is a single-page web app that helps you print formatted text directly on sticky notes. The layout mirrors a sheet of notes on a US letter page and includes tools for aligning content, previewing Markdown formatting, and printing with or without positioning guides.

## Usage

1. Open `docs/index.html` in your browser.
2. Enable **Show print guides**, configure the margins, gaps, and other layout settings, then print a blank sheet.
3. Laminate the printed guide sheet.
4. Place blank sticky notes on top of the guide boxes and load the laminated sheet into your printer following the feed instructions printed on the page.
5. Edit each note in the web page. You can use Markdown for rich formatting.
6. Toggle to preview mode to see the rendered Markdown. The app will automatically scale the preview font to fit the available space in each grid cell.
7. Disable **Show print guides** so the alignment lines and feed directions are hidden.
8. Print the notes; the printer will place your formatted text directly on the sticky notes.

> Tip: The toolbar includes a “Min font (px)” control. Increase it if you want to prevent the automatic scaling from reducing text below a comfortable size.
